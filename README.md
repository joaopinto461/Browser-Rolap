# ROLAP Browser

This project is a ROLAP Browser developed in PHP for Data Warehousing's 2015 class at FCT/UNL.

It covers the most important data warehousing concepts like cubes, dimensions, measures, hierarchies, levels and properties. The goal was to provide a dynamic interface for the user, in order to ease the extraction of valuable insights from a big dataset.

The interaction with the ROLAP Browser is made through drag and drop movements from the right sidebar to the table on the center. It's also possible to add filters and slices to view another perspective of the data.
