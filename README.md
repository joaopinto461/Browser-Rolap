# ROLAP Browser

This project is a ROLAP Browser developed for Data Warehousing's 2015 class @ FCT/UNL.

It covers the most important data warehousing concepts like cubes, dimensions, measures, hierarchies, levels and properties. The goal was to provide a dynamic interface for the user, in order to ease the extraction of valuable insights from a big database.
